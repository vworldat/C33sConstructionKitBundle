# This file is auto-updated each time construction-kit:update-blocks is called.
# This may happen automatically during various composer events (install, update)
#
# Follow these rules for your maximum building experience:
#
# [*] Only edit existing block classes in this file. If you need to add another custom building block class use the
#     composer extra 'c33s-building-blocks' or register your block as a tagged service (tag 'c33s_building_block').
#     Make sure your block implements C33s\ConstructionKitBundle\BuildingBlock\BuildingBlockInterface
#
# [*] You can enable or disable a full building block by simply setting the "enabled" flag to true or false, e.g.:
#     C33s\ConstructionKitBundle\BuildingBlock\ConstructionKitBuildingBlock:
#         enabled: true
#
#     If you enable a block for the first time, make sure the "force_init" flag is also set
#     C33s\ConstructionKitBundle\BuildingBlock\ConstructionKitBuildingBlock:
#         enabled: true
#         force_init: true
#
# [*] "use_config" and "use_assets" flags will only be used if block is enabled. They do not affect disabled blocks.
#
# [*] Asset lists will automatically be filled by all assets of asset-enabled blocks. To exclude specific assets, move them to their
#     respective "disabled" sections. You may also reorder assets - the order will be preserved.
#
# [*] Assets are made available through assetic using the @asset_group notation.
#
# [*] Custom YAML comments in this file will be lost!
